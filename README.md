# Memory Card Game
This memory card game was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  To win this game, users will have to rely on their memory and click on each card only once.  After each click, cards are shuffled to throw the user off.  Current Score and Best Score are tracked.
The project guidelines are listed in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card) JavaScript curriculum.
